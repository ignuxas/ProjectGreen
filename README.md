# ProjectGreen
Mostly a showcase of my code skills, thought process of mine while coding. The app scans through a skelbiu.lt item listing and lists all items in one place, mostly used to buy items for very cheap as soon as they are uploaded.

Can be tested out with link: https://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/?autocompleted=1&keywords=&submit_bn=&cost_min=&cost_max=&condition=2&cities=0&distance=0&mainCity=0&search=1&category_id=82&type=1&user_type=0&ad_since_min=0&ad_since_max=0&visited_page=1&orderBy=1&detailsSearch=0

Supported sound files: mp3/WAV

Note: The refresh time is in seconds, don't make it too little while scanning through a lot of pages, as python may not handle it (depents on how fast your computer is), never make the refresh time 0, as it will always break, and you will not be able to open it again unless you restart your computer or close the webserver.
